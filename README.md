Right now I have one problem. After i submit login
my navigation stops working. But if you go back to 
website everything works. Everything else seems fine
with authorization.

Fow now I created authentication on the server with golang.
FRONTEND structure
Front using js. I put fetching functions in handlers and
html pages in views.

I will start to add posts table and adding joins to 
user table.

BACKEND structure
Controllers fetch json from page and create model
and the send it to database connect. 
In database connect we check if given info is 
valid and send it to sqlite to insert data to db.
