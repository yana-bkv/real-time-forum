Right now I have one problem. After i submit login
my navigation stops working. But if you go back to 
website everything works. Everything else seems fine
with authorization.

Fow now I created authentication on the server with golang.
Front using js. I put fetching functions in handlers and
html pages in views.

I will start to add posts table and adding joins to 
user table.
